# Eve (Electric and fuel combustion vehicle Evaluation)
Car data collection, analysis and modelling

# 30/08/2021 
The first stage collecting raw data is done and updated. There are 76819 cars collected in the "data_collect_raw_08_30_2021.csv". 
The next stage is to clean the data. I made some mistakes during the scraping, and I want to write them here as a lesson. 
1. In the seller variables, there are approx. 50% data are wrongly repeated due to the coding issue. I found this issue until #47999 row. 
2. I did not classify the new and used cars, and most of the new cars do not record odometers whilst I applied the same approach of scraping these two categories.

generated three data tables: for all, new and used cars.  
Data generated in this project is for study purpose only.

Cross checked the data and did some minor changes.

Electric car data clean completed, ready to analysis.  
The output csv file is : "df_EV_clean.csv"

The overview of electric car analysis is completed.  
I will have to spend few days to be familiar with Shiny Package. I want to embed a calculator app into the blog to measure how much can be saved in 5/10/15 years if people switch from fuel combustion cars to pure electric cars, which is also a answer I want to find.  
In order to make the measurement accurate, I might take longer time to consider what variables is necessary. I plan to complete this calculator before October.
